# Folder Structure Audit

## Current Structure

The project currently follows this general structure:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── sections/
│   │   ├── frontend/
│   │   └── usability/
│   └── ui/
├── context/
├── hooks/
├── integrations/
│   └── supabase/
├── lib/
├── pages/
└── services/
```

## Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Separation of UI Components**: The UI components are well-organized in the `components/ui` directory.

2. **Feature Organization**: Content sections are properly grouped in the `components/sections` directory.

3. **Clear Service Separation**: Authentication and API services are separated into the `services` directory.

4. **Context Isolation**: Context providers are isolated in the `context` directory.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Lack of Feature-based Organization**: The current structure is primarily organized by technical concern rather than by feature.

2. **Flat Components Structure**: All components outside of UI are in a flat structure, which could become unwieldy as the application grows.

3. **Missing Types Directory**: TypeScript interfaces and types are scattered across files rather than centralized.

4. **Unclear API Boundary**: The boundary between frontend and external services could be more clearly defined.

5. **Mixed Responsibility in Pages**: Some page components contain both layout and business logic.

## Recommendations

### 1. Adopt a Feature-based Structure

Reorganize the codebase to group related files by feature, enhancing discoverability and maintainability:

```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── context/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── guide/
│   └── performance/
│       ├── database/
│       ├── frontend/
│       ├── backend/
│       └── infrastructure/
├── shared/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── types/
├── api/
│   └── supabase/
└── pages/
```

### 2. Standardize Component Structure

For each feature, maintain a consistent component structure:

```
feature/
├── components/              # UI components specific to this feature
├── hooks/                   # Custom hooks for this feature
├── services/                # Business logic and API calls
├── context/                 # State management for this feature
└── types.ts                 # TypeScript definitions
```

### 3. Improve Type Management

Create a dedicated `types` directory in the shared folder for common types, and feature-specific types within each feature directory:

```
src/
├── shared/
│   └── types/
│       ├── auth.ts
│       ├── user.ts
│       └── common.ts
└── features/
    └── feature/
        └── types.ts
```

### 4. Establish Clear API Boundaries

Create a clear separation between the frontend and external services:

```
src/
├── api/                     # All API-related code
│   ├── supabase/            # Supabase client and utilities
│   └── github/              # GitHub API integration
└── features/
    └── auth/
        └── services/        # Uses the API layer but doesn't directly handle connection details
```

### 5. Separate Layout from Pages

Extract layout components from pages to improve reusability:

```
src/
├── layouts/                 # Layout components
│   ├── MainLayout.tsx
│   ├── DashboardLayout.tsx
│   └── AuthLayout.tsx
└── pages/                   # Page components that use layouts
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Create the new directory structure in parallel with the existing one.

2. **Phase 2**: Gradually migrate components to their appropriate feature directories.

3. **Phase 3**: Refactor pages to use the new layout components.

4. **Phase 4**: Update imports throughout the codebase to point to the new locations.

5. **Phase 5**: Remove the old structure once migration is complete.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Easier to find related files and understand relationships.

2. **Better Scalability**: The structure can accommodate growth without becoming unwieldy.

3. **Enhanced Code Sharing**: Clear boundaries between shared and feature-specific code.

4. **Reduced Coupling**: Features become more self-contained and less dependent on other parts of the application.

5. **Easier Testing**: Well-defined boundaries make it easier to write unit and integration tests.
